When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am going share or working group or I need help you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because, other user update the remote repository, or I modify the remote
    repository, with the gitHub web browser. The pull command update the local
    repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Is like a clones, but, it's only in gitHub.
    Clones: Is when I copy a remote repository.
    Branch: Is a commit what go for other direction, so so, don't modify the
    branch main.

    Forks show the owner repository. good for the credibilidy to author.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
